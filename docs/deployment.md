# Deploying vboard to Vercel

At this handoff (2026-10-18), the Neon configuration and community-logo integration are prepared in source. The remote database is empty and has not been provisioned or migrated; the `vboard-assets` bucket is planned, not deployed. A successful build does not make those services ready. Real VOSS sign-in, remote database/RLS checks and logo upload/read remain unverified.

## Vercel environment variables

Set these in Vercel's Production environment before deploying. Use matching branch-scoped values for any Preview environment you intentionally configure. Never copy the current mixed local environment unchanged.

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon pooled connection for restricted `vboard_app`, with TLS. Do not use `neondb_owner`. |
| `AUTH_DATABASE_URL` | Connection to the same Neon branch/database as restricted `vboard_auth`, with TLS. No localhost URL or fallback to the owner connection. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Independent cryptographically random secret, at least 32 bytes. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Exact public HTTPS application origin, such as `https://vboard.vosslabs.org`. |
| `VOSS_DISCOVERY_URL` | `https://accounts.vosslabs.org/api/auth/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| `VOSS_CLIENT_ID` | vboard's own registered VAuth client ID. |
| `VOSS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Matching private client secret. |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` | The production branch's Neon Object Storage HTTPS endpoint. |
| `AWS_REGION` | The storage endpoint's region; override any unrelated Vercel default. |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Production branch storage credential ID. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Matching storage secret with write access, kept server-side. |
| `NEON_STORAGE_BUCKET` | `vboard-assets`, declared as `public_read` in `neon.ts`. |

Leave `VBOARD_DEV_AUTH` entirely absent from Vercel. The build rejects it. Administrative `DIRECT_URL`, provisioning passwords and `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` belong in deployment infrastructure, not application runtime. Setting `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` only in Vercel does not grant authority: provisioning synchronizes the private SQL allowlist.

The current app requires the canonical hosted VAuth discovery URL and issuer even when vboard itself runs locally. A localhost VAuth discovery URL disables this provider. Register the exact callback `${BETTER_AUTH_URL}/api/auth/oauth2/callback/voss` with the hosted provider; substitute the actual origin rather than using that expression literally. A new Vercel preview origin needs its own allowed callback and matching client configuration. See [VOSS authentication](./voss-auth.md).

## GitHub deployment environment

Create the `production-database` GitHub environment and set the exact secrets consumed by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PRODUCTION_DIRECT_URL` | Direct, unpooled administrative Neon connection for provisioning and migrations. |
| `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` | Same restricted `vboard_app` URL configured in Vercel. |
| `PRODUCTION_AUTH_DATABASE_URL` | Same bounded `vboard_auth` URL configured in Vercel. |
| `PRODUCTION_APP_PASSWORD` | Password used when provisioning `vboard_app`; must match its runtime URL. |
| `PRODUCTION_AUTH_PASSWORD` | Password used when provisioning `vboard_auth`; must match its runtime URL. |
| `PRODUCTION_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated verified `@vit.edu.in` addresses to synchronize into the private SQL allowlist. |
| `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` | Private Vercel production deployment hook for this project. |

The workflow provisions roles/allowlist, applies ordered migrations, checks migration history and verifies restricted database principals before requesting a Vercel release. It does not provision Object Storage. Review `neon config plan` for the supplied production target, then run `neon deploy` to create the declared bucket. Preserve existing environment files: CLI env pull supplies owner-level database URLs, which must not replace the restricted runtime URLs above.

`vercel.json` disables automatic deployments from `main`. If the PR merges before these GitHub secrets are configured, the deployment workflow skips its mutating steps; that is not a successful release. After configuring both environments and provisioning storage, run **Deploy production** manually in GitHub Actions. Observe the actual Vercel build/deployment result; acceptance of the deployment hook alone does not establish health.

Do not run a seed, reset or schema push against this remote target. Use the existing numbered SQL migrations. Before updating an existing dataset, inventory it and retain a private recovery point. Neon provisioning privileges and all RLS checks still need verification against the actual target.

## Service checks after release

1. Open `/` and `/communities`; confirm database-backed pages load. Verify a real hosted VOSS sign-in and sign-out with a verified VIT account.
2. Verify Super admin/Lead/Organizer/Student boundaries using actual current SQL assignments. Creating a community or editing its settings must persist after reload and produce the existing audit entry.
3. As Lead or Super admin, upload a PNG/JPEG/WebP logo of at most 2 MiB in community settings. Save, reload and confirm the logo loads on the public community list/detail. An Organizer or Student must be unable to change settings.
4. Confirm rejected image types/oversize files fail, and verify that no credentials appear in browser assets, image URLs or shared logs.

Public logos use immutable keys and cache headers. The database stores a branch-independent `neon://` reference; rendering uses the current branch's storage endpoint. Existing external HTTP(S) image URLs remain supported. Old logo objects are retained when replaced/removed. A failed SQL save attempts to remove only its new upload; process interruption or cleanup failure can leave an unreferenced object. Storage cleanup failures produce a sanitized structured server error.

No remote restore, application rollback or live provider exchange has been verified for this release. Migration files commit individually with their checksum ledger entry; correct a failed migration's cause and rerun without editing already applied files. There are no down migrations. A recovery must keep database state and the application version compatible; never use seed or reset as recovery.
